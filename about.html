                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p> With a vision and mission to have Happy Empowered Children in slums, weCare Foundation reaches
                        out to children in urban
                        slums, villages, and on construction sites and changes their lives through education and skills.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        We work in the largest state of India - Uttar Pradesh. The issue that we are trying to address
                        is the removal of abject
                        poverty in slums through education and skilling of children.

                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        We become a part of the community by setting up permanent Yellow Rooms and create a sustainable
                        transformational
                        environment for all the children in that vicinity. We work for them to become happy,
                        gender-equal, empathetic, educated,
                        sensitive, and ethical human beings.</p>
                    <br><br>

                    There are 3 board members with us. We are a team of 30 full-time employees and around 40 volunteers
                    and interns. We have
                    an Advisory Board of 5 experienced members. The Founder has quit his corporate and academic career
                    and has been working
                    in a full-time capacity in an honorary position. We have a fantastic strength of more than 300
                    lovely donors who have
                    been taking this cause ahead.</p>
                    <p>
                        We at weCare charity foundation do our bit in bridging the gap between the privileged and
                        unprivileged. From organizing
                        evening free classes to managing the school and other needs of these kids who are displaced or
                        their social status doesn't allow them to get that.
                        We collaborate with other NGOs, Government officials, and many young and old privileged people
                        around and organize
                        regular visits to slums.
                    </p>
